    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">MDN Web Docs define web security as the act/practice of protecting websites from unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction, or disruption. The purpose of website security is to prevent attacks that can among other things make the website unavailable due to denial of service, or that cause passwords, email addresses, and credit card details being leaked into the public domain. Web security requires design efforts in many different areas of the website. It is required in your web application, in the configuration of the web server, in the policies for creating and renewing password and in the client-side code. Luckily, server-side web framework will almost certainly enable robust and well-thought-out defence mechanisms against many of the more common attacks. In addition, one should also enable HTTPS and make use of the many publicly available vulnerability scanner tools that can help find obvious mistakes on the website. Acunetix states that there are two key aspects to secure software development: 1. practices that can help make fewer errors when writing application code, and 2. practices that help you detect and eliminate errors early. There are many different kinds of web security threats, but the more common ones are called Cross-Site scripting, SQL injection, and Cross-Site request forgery. According to Acunetix software developers must be educated about these threats, and about even more vulnerabilities and misconfiguration. In addition, they must also know security standards, secure coding techniques, algorithms, mechanisms, and tools required to build secure web applications.</p>
